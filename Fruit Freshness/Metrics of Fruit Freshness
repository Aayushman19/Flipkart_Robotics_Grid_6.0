For black and purple grapes, optimal storage conditions and shelf life can vary depending on temperature and humidity:

1. *Ideal Storage (0-2°C, 90-95% RH): To maximize freshness, grapes should be stored in a cool environment around **0-2°C (32-35°F)* with *90-95% relative humidity. This slows down ripening and minimizes moisture loss, allowing grapes to stay fresh for **up to 2 weeks* under these ideal conditions
2. *High Temperature and Low Humidity (T > 20°C, H < 60%): When grapes are stored at higher temperatures and lower humidity, they tend to dehydrate and spoil rapidly. In such conditions, the shelf life is typically reduced to **1-3 days* due to faster moisture loss.

3. *Room Temperature (15-20°C, 60-80% RH): At room temperature, grapes can last **3-5 days* but will start to lose their crisp texture and may develop mold if humidity is too high.

4. *Freezing Temperatures (below 0°C): While freezing grapes can extend their storage for several months, it can affect texture when thawed. If kept below **0°C*, grapes may suffer from freezer burn or crystallization, reducing quality upon thawing.

5. *Moderate Humidity (60-85% RH) with Cool Temperature (5-10°C): Storing grapes in moderately cool conditions with slightly lower humidity can help retain their texture for **5-7 days*, although quality may not be as optimal as in higher humidity settings.

1. *Optimal Storage (13-15°C, 90-95% RH): Brown bananas should ideally be stored at **13-15°C (56-59°F)* with *90-95% relative humidity* to prevent further ripening and slow down spoilage. Under these conditions, bananas can maintain their quality for *3-5 days*. Lower temperatures may lead to chilling injuries, while lower humidity increases dehydration risks【34†source】【36†source】.

2. *High Temperature (>20°C): At temperatures above **20°C (68°F), brown bananas spoil more rapidly due to increased enzymatic activity. They will last **1-2 days* before becoming mushy and overripe. High temperatures accelerate the breakdown of the cell structure, especially in already ripe bananas【35†source】.

3. *Refrigeration (<12°C): If bananas are stored below **12°C, chilling injury can occur, causing the skin to turn black and making the flesh mushy within **1-3 days* after removal from the fridge. This injury is due to disrupted cellular processes caused by the low temperature, particularly in bananas that are already ripe【36†source】【35†source】.

4. *Freezing (below 0°C)*: Freezing brown bananas can extend their shelf life for several months, but the texture may degrade upon thawing, making them suitable primarily for baking or smoothies.

1. *Refrigeration (0-4°C, 90% RH): The best way to store green apples is in the refrigerator, ideally in the crisper drawer, where the temperature can be kept between **0-4°C (32-40°F)* with about *90% relative humidity. Under these conditions, green apples can stay fresh for **up to 3 weeks*. The high humidity helps retain moisture, while the cool temperature slows down the ripening process【65†source】【66†source】.

2. *Room Temperature (18-21°C): At room temperature, green apples will ripen more quickly and last **5-7 days*. It's important to keep them in a cool, shaded, and well-ventilated area, away from ethylene-producing fruits like bananas, which can speed up ripening【67†source】【68†source】.

3. *Freezing (<0°C): Freezing is an option for long-term preservation. Apples can be sliced and blanched before freezing to prevent browning. This method can extend their shelf life for **6-12 months*, although freezing may alter the texture【66†source】.

For green bananas, proper storage significantly affects their shelf life. Here’s how different conditions influence their longevity:

1. *Optimal Storage (13-14°C, 90-95% RH): Green bananas are best stored at **13-14°C (55-58°F)* with a relative humidity of *90-95%. These conditions help delay ripening by slowing down the respiration rate and minimizing moisture loss. Under these optimal conditions, green bananas can maintain quality for **2-4 weeks* before ripening begins. This approach is commonly used during transportation to prevent premature ripening【78】【79】【81】.

2. *Room Temperature (20-25°C): At room temperature, green bananas will ripen over **5-7 days* as they transition from green to yellow. Warmer temperatures accelerate the breakdown of starches into sugars, leading to faster ripening. This is the standard practice for ripening bananas naturally【78】【81】.

3. *Low Temperature (<13°C): Temperatures below **13°C* can cause chilling injury in bananas. Symptoms include peel discoloration, such as dark brown streaks or blackening, and potentially prevent proper ripening. Even brief exposure to temperatures below the threshold can cause these symptoms, particularly in green bananas【79】【80】.
